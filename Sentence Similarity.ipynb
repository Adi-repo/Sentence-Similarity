      "2. The date slicer is not displaying all the available dates: This could be due to the range of dates selected in the slicer. To resolve this issue, adjust the range of dates displayed in the slicer or increase the granularity of the slicer.\n",
      "3. The date slicer is not working at all: This could be due to a corrupted Power BI file or a bug in the Power BI software. To resolve this issue, try restarting Power BI or creating a new file and recreating the date slicer.\n",
      "4. The date slicer is not interacting with other visuals or filters: This could be due to the order of the visuals in the report page or incorrect interaction settings. To resolve this issue, adjust the order of the visuals or update the interaction settings to ensure that the date slicer is interacting with the desired visuals and filters.\n",
